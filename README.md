# Project Gun Run
A semi-complete simulation for 4 wheel a vehicle. Consider this (also) a portfolio demonstration. That said, I would love to see what you can do with it. See the next section.
# Copying (this is for you, Github user):
I don't mind if you clone or copy this repo, and in fact I'd be honored.

My only stipulation is because this is the culmination of lots of hard work,
I ask that you don't turn around and sell or claim this source code (or the assets within) as your own.
If you want to use it as a base for your project go right ahead.
I just want to see some significant extensions made if you're going to do that.
I've included an example model for playing around with.
Its in the general shape of a ford f-150, and its set up for direct use with the VehicleWizard script.

This project is a simulation Therefore you're going to need some AI skills to manage controlling these vehicles... Hope you'll get some use out of it! :
I almost forgot there is no audio framework in this either. That's just outside the scope of my projects as of now. 

Lastly I'd like to add that you must give credit where credit is due in any derivations. That is, add an attribution giving credit to CS-Cowboy (ie. link to this repo). I encourage you to fork and/or copy this all you want (provided credit is given). Doesn't bother me one bit.
